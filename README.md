**Summary:**

This data science visualization captures the various roles, skills and industries that are most prevalent in the practice. It is meant to illustrate the breadth and depth of the complex relationships and patterns that emerged from our research.

Specifically, this data viz shows relationships between:

*The 6 major roles within the field (listed in strategic order within top center wedge)

*The 8 essential types of work they do (identified in center, distinguished by color, and ordered by the most common, chronological sequence in which they occur, moving from left to right)

*8 top industries where data science is being utilized the most, and thus are (or could be) employing the most skills in the varying capacities identified with the 8 colors.

*This graphic is intended to show “lines of best fit,” for relationships within the “moving target,” field of data science; the rules and standards are still being written and changing by the day

*The door is still open for lots of additional research about specifics, with this graphic being the starting point, and presenting the opportunity of potentially making this chart interactive and more engaging

**Key:**

*Rings = Roles in DS Field 

*Wedges = Top Industries for DS Work

*Colored blocks = Type of work typically performed by a role within an industry
